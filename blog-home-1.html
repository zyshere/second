            <h2 class="card-title">Why a graphic designer should be respected.</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Graphic design is evolving, nowadays it is necessary to be practically a chameleon to be an important piece in the constant transformation of a world that is governed by consumerism and capitalism. Every designer on the planet has had to change their perspective, accelerate their pace and forge new paths that allow them to position themselves in the market, due to the excessive growth of the competition.

</p>  <p class="card-text">From the perspective of many, graphic design itself, no longer works. The demand forces a graphic designer to have at least ten other tasks (that mostly don’t belong to their career), in order to get a job or achieve some dream promotion. Several examples of the aforementioned take place in the field of marketing, professionals in this field must have knowledge of design to be successful, but they do not study five or six years to specialize; However, by taking a Photoshop course, they are already the direct competitors of graphic designers, and in many cases, they get the jobs that design professionals should obtain by right, and then who do we blame?

</p>Is it the fault of the designers themselves? Those who end up accepting work that requires them to have knowledge of a thousand other things that are not part of their true tasks? Those who accept to create large projects for low pay? Those who accelerate processes by downloading templates to finish the projects in just a few hours ?, the answer is yes and no. Designers must be trained for absolutely everything, but this does not mean that new design talents are willing to humiliate themselves to get a job.

But then, what is necessary for a design professional to stand out? The key lies in the roots of design, that is: Visual communication. By definition, visual communication is described as “a transmission of information and ideas in a variety of ways that can be perceived in whole or in part, simply by sight.” This means that visual communication has a message with the power to inform or persuade the user.

And is not graphic design the same as visual communication? The answer is: it depends. A graphic design professional is trained to conceive, program, project and perform visual communication in each of the projects he performs, however, in many cases, the competition induces these professionals to succumb to the ease and become one more of the bunch, when downloading templates or placing their ideas in lockers with limitations, only to meet the times or expectations of their bosses, colleagues or clients.

I once heard that a good design project should be able to talk. That is why today ask the questions: Does your project speak? What does it say? What message does it express? It is necessary to understand that a good design is always going to say something, and this is where I must emphasize that the point of difference between a true design professional, and the rest of the professionals who only have vague knowledge of how to use a computer program, It is THE MESSAGE.

It is not enough to make something look good, it is not enough to place some shapes, turn them around and present them in color. It is necessary that a good design has a powerful message, a creative composition and a feeling behind it. It is time for the world to change the perspective it has of design professionals, and the change must begin in us, the designers.

Stop designing by templates, stop wanting to satisfy everyone, stop forcing ourselves to present a finished project in just a few hours, and stop humiliating us just for a job! Our work involves a beautiful process of exploration, research, composition and innovation. The roots of every good designer involve visual communication, social study and even psychological mastery. We must assess each element and resource that our work implies, and the important thing is to begin with the process of making others understand that our work is valuable, and that, as professionals, we deserve respect.
